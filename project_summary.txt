Global Sales Performance Dashboard (2012–2015)

This project analyzes over 17,000 global sales transactions to evaluate
sales performance, profitability, and regional trends.

Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned and transformed raw data, created KPIs,
and built an interactive dashboard with pivot tables, charts, and slicers.

Key insights from the analysis include:
- Technology category generates approximately 2x higher profit margin than Furniture despite similar sales volumes.
- Western Europe contributes about 25% of total sales and profit, with the top three regions accounting for over 50% of total profit.
- Sales grew steadily from 2012 to 2015, while profit growth lagged behind revenue growth, indicating margin pressure.

This project demonstrates the ability to translate data into measurable
business insights and support data-driven decision-making.
